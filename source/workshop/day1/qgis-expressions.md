Expressions in Context
======================

“Expressions are a core component of QGIS. They let you define rules to govern just
about ever aspect of QGIS behaviour.”

In this module we will introduce the concept of expressions. If you ever created a
spreadsheet formula, you should be on familiar ground here. Expressions are one of the
most powerful features of QGIS. You can use them to control things like labelling
behaviour, symbology behaviour, map composition behaviour and calculate values for
attributes.

You try:

Goal: Use an expression to scale the symbol size of cities according to their population.
* Start a new project, set the CRS to 4326
* Load the 10m places layer
* Filter / subset the layer as per the table on right
* Find out the minimum (A) and maximum (B) values of pop_max
* Edit the data defined property for the symbol size as per the size property in the table, right.
* Make sure to substitute A and B with the real values your discovered in the step above...


Check your results:

Do bigger cities have smaller markers than smaller ones? 

How would you adjust the expression if you wanted to decrease the maximumn icon size?
